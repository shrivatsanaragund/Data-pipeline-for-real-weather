# Data Pipeline for Real-Time Weather

## Overview
- Designed and implemented a scalable Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline utilizing Apache Airflow on an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring seamless extraction of real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API. Leveraged AWS EC2 instances for computing power, optimizing performance and enabling the processing of large volumes of data efficiently. 
- Utilized Amazon S3 for scalable storage, ensuring the secure and reliable storage of extracted weather data, while facilitating easy access and retrieval for downstream processes. Orchestrated data workflows effectively using Apache Airflow, enabling automation and scheduling of data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and reliability. 

- Implemented error handling mechanisms and monitoring tools to ensure data pipeline robustness and reliability, allowing for proactive identification and resolution of potential issues.
